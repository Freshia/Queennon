# Queennon #

## What it does ##
 Queennon takes your spotify playlist and automatically generates a playlist with similar (but not the same) songs. This way, you discover more music and artists that you like.

## Why the name? ##
The name came from two music legends, The band Queen and John Lennon, hence Queennon! :)

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd Queennon
$ sbt
> jetty:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
